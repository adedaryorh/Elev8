# create a variable that keep counts of user's remaining lives
# start the game in a while loop
# print blank lines for each letter in the random word list
# ask for user input
# check if user input is in random word list 
# if yes replace the blank in the other list and ask the user for another input
# if not reduce out of the lives of the current player and display the hangman pics showing how the user is hanging the man
# if the user has guessed all the word print you win and stop the game
